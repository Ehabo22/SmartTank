# SmartTank
Embedded system final project
The SmartTank is a toy tank with a miniature projectile launcher. The microcontroller manages tank movement and firing. DC motors allow multidirectional movement. These motors and the PIC16F877A microcontroller control the tank.
The tank fires projectiles using a controlled method of launch. SmartTank's HC-05 Bluetooth module offers remote control. The module simplifies smartphone tank management and on-demand shooting, improving user experience and system flexibility. The launching process is regulated by DC motors and a Servomotor.
